#  Wireless Oil Skimmer Robot

A Wi-Fi-enabled robotic system designed for environmental cleanup by skimming floating oil from water surfaces. Built using the ESP32 microcontroller and integrated with the Blynk IoT platform, the robot offers remote control of key components and basic obstacle detection through mobile app integration.

##  Project Overview

The Wireless Oil Skimmer Robot is an IoT-enabled robotic system developed to address environmental concerns related to oil pollution on water surfaces. This compact and modular robot automates the oil collection process using a rotating drum mechanism designed to attract and capture floating oil efficiently. Mobility is achieved through dual propeller motors, enabling smooth navigation across the water surface. A relay-controlled water pump assists in the collection and discharge of liquid waste.

All components are controlled wirelessly via a smartphone using the Blynk IoT platform, providing real-time control and monitoring. An onboard ultrasonic sensor enables basic obstacle detection and avoidance, making the system semi-autonomous and user-friendly. Designed with a focus on low cost, ease of deployment, and adaptability, the robot offers a practical solution for small-scale environmental cleanup operations.
